# Quick Start

In this Docs, I'll guide you step-by-step, to help you ready for joining this project.

## Intro Technologies & Weapons

Here is some cool technology I have been using for this project.

### Frameworks & Libraries

- First of all, this project use **NextJS**, which will be render all HTML by SSR or SSG. And this will be really good for Google's Bot, as well as other search machine. It will help our website SEO better. [See NextJS Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started)
- Secondary, We use **Tailwind** + **Styled-Component**. Please read a really nice blog talk about this in here: [How to Style Your React Apps with Less Code Using Tailwind CSS, Styled Components, and Twin Macro](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-style-your-react-apps-with-less-code-using-tailwind-css-and-styled-components/). Enjoin your reading!
- Tertiary, **Next-i18next**. Well this is the best framework for multiple language. With [Check next-i18next docs](https://github.com/isaachinman/next-i18next)
- **Formik**. This will help us control this Form in HTML. Everyone know that Form is really hard. so this will help us not also value controller but also validation of inputs. [Formik docs](https://formik.org/docs/overview)
- **HeadlessUI**

### Code Formatter

- **Prettier**. Well this will simply keep your code cleanly.

## VSCode extension

Too make sure you will be given fully support of coding. Please use VSCode.

- **Code spell check**. This tool will help you won't be taken silly spell mistakes
- **Prettier**. This is clean-code-keeper which will make sure your code isn't like s\*\*t. And make sure you turn on "Auto format when save". Check this [Blog](https://www.codereadability.com/automated-code-formatting-with-prettier/)
- **i18n-ally**. A tool sport you in writing multiple language.
- **Headwind**. A tool will automatically source your class tailwind or twin.

## VSCode snippets

This is powerful tool, which is natively written by us.  
Simply, it will help you write code faster.
